    <h1>about us</h1>
    <h4>history</h4>
    <p>The idea of putting up an appliance store was hatched in August, 1974. Market analysis, buyer characteristics and preferences, capital requirements, and projected returns were assembled and carefully studied. This resulted in a calculated approach designed to capture a minimal segment of the market at the outset. Thus, a new, fragile and unassuming organization was born.<b> La Imperial (LI) </b>was the adopted company name. It was a single proprietorship in form but a family partnership in context.</p>
    <p>The highy competitive nature of the appliance market required a tremendous struggle to stay afloat. The meager capital outfit had to contend with numerous and more established competitors. In March of 1982, the company was converted into a corporation. The move raised capitalization to a competitive level. The company grew rapidly in the late 1980's.</p>
    <p>After covering the whole of Region VI, the company continued to move forward and in the 1990's, LI branches began sprouting in the major cities in Mindanao. Later in 1996, the company successfully ventured into the Luzon area.</p>
    <p>In its 47 years of existence, the company has opened 61 branches nationwide. Since the company has a great opportunity to succeed in terms of commercial, industrial and institutional purposes, LI was built to serve each of these - 80 percent of which is company-owned buildings and are standing on lots owned by La Imperial.</p>
    <h4>vision</h4>
    <p>Today, as it has been in the beginning, La Imperial has made a name being "your home partner" through its customer - centered quality of service and with the aim of being the<b> "No.1 Suki ng Bayan"</b>. Our main vision is to become the country's leader in marketing, sales and distribution of quality home appliances.
